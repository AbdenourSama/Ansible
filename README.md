You can find here a list of use cases i have implemented using Ansible:

1- BashUpdate.yml : this is to upgrade bash to the latest version (to patch the "ShellShock" vulnerability).

2- Nginx PHP-FPM : Deploy Nginx web server with php-fpm and a server block for a new domain.

Hope you can find it usefull, if you have any comments please feel free to contact me.

Kind Regards.
