You can find here a list of use cases i have implemented using Ansible:

1- BashUpdate : this is to upgrade bash to the latest version (to patch the "ShellShock" vulnerability).

2- Nginx PHP-FPM : Deploy Nginx web server with php-fpm and a server block for a new domain.

3- SystemMonitoring: this playbook collects some information about tha status remote RedHat/CentOS systems and create a small report.

Hope you can find it usefull, if you have any comments please feel free to contact me.

Kind Regards.
